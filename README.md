## How It Works

1. **Create a Group:** The user creates a group by specifying the group name, members, and the token for transactions (e.g., USDT).
2. **Add Expenses:** Group members can add expenses, specifying the amount, description, and participants.
3. **Smart Settlements:** The dApp automatically calculates and settles debts between members using smart contracts.
4. **View Balances and History:** Members can track their balances and expense history transparently on the blockchain.
